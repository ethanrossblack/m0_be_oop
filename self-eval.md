# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    - This was the most satisfying challenge yet! It took me a while to get the Hobbit class correct, but once I did, I felt as accomplished as Samwise Gamgee after he slaid Shelob the spider.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    - My workflow is going ok. If I remember to take breaks, drink enough water, and eat a good lunch, I'm great. If I forget to do one of those things, or if I'm late on eating my lunch, I slow down a little bit. I also notice that around 5, 5:30 my brain slows down.


- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
    - Always check that attributes referenced inside a class have the @ symbol before them. I forgot several times and it took me a while to figure out what was going wrong with my code.
    - Keep going at it. You'll get it eventually.
